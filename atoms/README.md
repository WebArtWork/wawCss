This folder lists the atomic classes of our framework that are currently in use.
Atomic Classes CSS uses a dense class name library. Classes are named abbreviations and derive from the content to which they are assigned.
The atomic classes are grouped into separate blocks and formed in the following order:
- text
- margin
- padding
- flex style
- color
These blocks create separate selectors with different values. In the "text" block, for example, all values ​​will be related to the text, such as alignment, font size or boldness, etc.
Accordingly, the "margin" and "padding" blocks must be indented or indented. Indentations can be specified for only one side and set to all parties at once.
The "flex style" block contains atomic classes that are responsible for aligning the flex container elements.
The "color" block contains atomic classes that specify the color of text or icons.
It should be remembered that atomic classes are not always used, only when needed. It is usually necessary to edit a block by selecting it into a separate full-fledged class.
