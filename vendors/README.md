Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides the best cross-browser style for HTML elements in default styles.

The goals of normalize.css are:
- Save useful browser settings, but not erase them;
- Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements
- Correct errors and major browser inconsistencies;
- Improve usability with inconspicuous improvements;
- Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.
It supports a wide range of browsers (including mobile ones) and includes CSS that normalizes HTML5 elements, typography, lists, inline content, forms and tables.

Despite the fact that the project is based on the principle of normalization, it uses standard settings where they are preferable.
